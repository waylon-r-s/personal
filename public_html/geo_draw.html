  <h1>Geometric Bear</h1>
  <h3>by Javier Maldonado-Orozco and Waylon Rios-Sherman</h3>

  <img src="images/bear.jpeg" alt="Geometric art of a bear's head."> <iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/835610003/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  
  <p>We choose this drawing of a bear because it showed up when we looked geometric art and found it absolutely hilarious for some reason. There is nothing particularly special about it and it seems to come from a drawing activity of some kind for children.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Our version of it was made using arrays, as Javi called them, or lists, as scratch them, making up the coordinates that the pen needs to cross over. After the pen goes through all the coordinates on the right side, it picks up and repeats the steps on the other side by simplying multiplying the xCoord variable by -1. We also removed some of the minor details because we couldn't be bothered to do some of the minutiae.</p>
