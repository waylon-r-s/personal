  <h1>Psionics in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition</h1>
  <p> Psionics, another name for psychic abilities, have a weird history with Dungeons & Dragons. From what I have gathered, in previous editions, their implementation was always obtuse, and now in 5th edition they have been greatly reduced, being limited to only a handful of subclasses. There was once a psionic class known as <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/UAMystic3.pdf">the Mystic</a> being playtested, but it was quickly and, in my opinion, unfairly scrapped for being 'too complicated' and 'too overpowered.' These subclasses leave much to be desired, with their psychic abilities feeling very limited in scope.
  <br>
  In my experience playing the scrapped Mystic class (my character in a campaign with friends is one,) it feels much more thematically and mechanically satisfying, but I personally feel the psionic ability mechanics presented are in need of refinement, which is to be expected of playtest material.</p>
  
  <h2>A New Supplement</h2>
  <p>Feeling the need for more refined rules and mechanics for psionic abilities, I began writing a list of rules, disciplines (sets of psionic powers) and workshopping ideas for new classes. This document can be found <a href="https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/EofhDPrimw-P">here.</a> Writing supplementary content for Dungeons & Dragons deviates from the creative writing I typically do in that it also contains the aspect of game design. This supplement is not yet finished, but shortly I will begin testing some of the mechanics for projecting psionic powers in the aforementioned campaign with friends where I play a Mystic.
  <br>
  The basis for this content was the Mystic class's disciplines, talents, and psi points. From these concepts, I have attempted to introduce limitations in psionic capacity and concentration requirements, and means of detection in psychic disturbances, with the goal of making psionic abilities more distinct and feel less like "magic but better." I have also changed the thematic elements of disciplines to be distinct lines of thought that are projected as psychic powers, and moved talents from essentially being the same as cantrips that magic classes get to being tied to discipline as the basis of that line of thought.
  <br>
  Besides coherent thematic elements, my main concern has been ensuring that the mechanical elements are balanced. Unfortunately, before playtesting, the best I can do is look at what existing material can do at certain levels and estimate the amount of dice to roll for damage. Another difficulty is also making sure that the disciplines and powers are functional outside of combat, because while much of the mechanical base of Dungeons & Dragons is for combat, the reason for that is that the roleplay is open-ended, so you have to design for elements to be functional in all three pillars (roleplay, exploration, combat.)</p>
