  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Allow me to begin by quickly apologizing if this autobiographical section seems disjointed or awkward, I don’t typically write about myself and it’s always felt uncomfortable, but we’d never get anywhere if we only did what was comfortable.</p>
  <p>Hi, I’m Waylon. I spent the first 12 years of my life in Southern California before moving to Oregon in late 2018. Growing up, I always loved to tell stories or workshop ideas. Growing up, most of my play was telling interactive stories to my brothers (think of something similar to Dungeons & Dragons, but without all the rules,) or going outside with my older brother and discussing all the video games we dreamed of making one day. I never really went to school until 8th grade, we did this thing my mom called “unschooling,” but it hasn’t severely impacted my academic performance past the first month or so of adjusting to how public schooling works. Even before schooling, I’ve always had a strong drive to learn and to create, which has most often manifested itself as writing, in various forms. I have dedicated this website to showcasing samples of my writing, including excerpts from short stories that I honestly never get around to finishing,, my creation of a fantasy setting for Dungeons & Dragons, known as Aedrenna, and an ongoing attempt to create a supplement for Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition.</p>
