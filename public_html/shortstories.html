<h1>Short Stories</h1>
<p>I have worked on many short stories over the years, although I never finish them. These include science fiction, fantasy, and even a dystopian story or two. Despite their unfinished nature, I believe they have all still been worthwhile efforts, and I have included excerpts from several of them below.</p>

<h2>Aerotram</h2>
<p class="excerpt">The hot foundries of the subterranean factories were among the most miserable places on Earth, getting worse every layer one went down. The enclosed cityspace became so heated that heatsinks and air pumps were established around the layered megacities. The noise of the pumps kept entire apartment blocks up some nights.
For the upper stratum, life was that of a businessman. Buy, sell, buy, sell, buy, sell, line and bar graphs flying past on city square screens. Lines went up, lines went down, entire city-wide industries traded hands on the hour, whole layers were bought and sold in some of the highest circles of society. The constant buzz of information drove some mindnumb, and they lost it all, and their fate was removal to lower layers upon failure to pay rent.
By now some of the subterranean laborers realized that the value of their plots of home and factory were dependent on the labor they output. So they organized, they formed unions, they striked. It was a beautiful effort, for a while, the iron grip of the terraneans challenged by proto-revolutionaries. Then paramilitaries and paid mercenaries crushed the unions, and they were outlawed.
The subterranean citizens were no less human, though. The elderly smiled seeing their children and grandchildren visit, adults laughed, teenagers loved, and the children dreamed of the stars. Star projector night lights were among the most popular gifts for youth and new parents.</p>

<p>This excerpt comes from a story that was set in a world where the population centers of Earth had become colossal, layered cities, with social classes separated into layers. The name comes from the focal point of the plotline, an "aerotram" designed to carry citizens between layers, to help alleviate the stagnant social hierarchy and create some sense of social mobility. The first aerotram would, unfortunately, collapse and fail, killing and injuring dozens, and causing mass protests.</p>

<h2>Tales from Aedrenna</h2>
<p class="excerpt">DURING THE AGE OF SWORDS there was an island known as Anedonna. Anedonna was the home of the first Aedic people, known as the Aedites, and the strongest kingdom of elves and tiefs known to history.
	On the island of Anedonna, in a year forgotten by most every living person, as well as most dead, was born a child of Lyura[1], named Aenedonnus, or the son of Aenedon.
	Aenedonnus was born an unnaturally brawny child, appearing to be three years old by the time he was one, and appearing to be a young adult by the time he was a boy. For this reason he stood out noticeably from the rest of the Aedites, and excelled in his class of fifty young soldiers.
	Aenedonnus graduated from the soldiers’ school earlier than anyone else had before or would after, being a natural master of sword and sorcery. And at the same time Aenedonnus graduated, a war of succession broke out in Anedonna.
	The old Queen-Ruler of Anedonna had passed away without a consort or heir to her throne, and so the noble court fought amongst themselves for the seat she left.
	Besides the nobles, many poorer Aedites also took up arms to fight for the throne themselves, and among them was the strong soldier Aenedonnus.
	Aenedonnus traveled by beast to the capital palace of Anedonna and there he spoke out to the many sparring warriors competing for the throne.
	"Quiet!" Aenedonnus shouted, and the only sound that followed was that of spear and sword clattering to the stoned roads leading into the chambers.
	"Fight no more, child of life and death, for the new King of All Aedites has arrived!" Aenedonns declared to challengers of the throne, and to the land of Aedia as a whole.
	"Why should we listen to some random person who walks up and claims the throne like we all did?" An onlooker cried.
	"If you dispute my claim to the throne, then raise your sword and strike swiftly my neck." Aenedonnus shouted.
	And the onlooker could not raise their sword. Try as they might, no other challengers could raise neither sword nor spear, as they felt heavier than deepstone[2]. Nor could they ready their magic to strike Aenedonnus, who stood patiently waiting for any attack[3].
	And so the fighting ended, the claimants all conceding to Aenedonnus. And thus he was crowned Aenod of Anedonna.
	<br>
1. It is not made clear whether or not Aenedonnus was an Elf or a Tiefling, or a mix of the two.
	<br>
2. 'Deepstone' is referenced widely in legends from during and before the Age of Sorcery, it is believed to refer to the then little known element of Ithyx, found in the Underdark and known for its strange behavior in relation to weight and wielding.
	<br>
3. Though now commonly known, at the time of the Age of Swords, anti-magic was a rare natural phenomenon, and so this was likely an act of divine interference or a lucky coincidence, or a fabrication made to support the supernatural powers attested to Aenedonnus in later tales.</p>
<p>This is one of several stories from a collection of folk stories I was working on set in Aedrenna, a worldbuilding project detailed here. This collection of short stories, each about a page or so long, was inspired by reading a collection of myths and legends of the <a class="line" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaqui">Yaqui people</a> (I am part Yaqui, and was interested in learning more about the mythology of the people.) It reflects many elements of Aedrenna’s earliest drafts, including the different Ages and the sunken Empire of Anedonna. Most of these ideas have since been scrapped or repurposed, but I personally believe that writing short folk stories can be a valuable exercise in worldbuilding, since it helps in not only fleshing out the world’s lore, but the people of the world and their cultures.</p>

<h2>Untitled Story</h2>
<p class=excerpt>Sometimes it doesn’t feel like I’m here, it feels like I’ll wake up and I’ll be back in the world I knew and I’ll be thinking about marrying the man I love and living a relatively normal life. Now I don’t know if I’ll even be alive by tomorrow night. I’m one slip away from being caught, detained, tried, and executed.
All those feelings came to a head once, a few months ago. It was almost midnight and I started crying and screaming that I wanted to go home and Sinclair had to hold me down and cover my mouth before someone called the MPs. I still feel guilty about that. I could’ve gotten both of us arrested, or worse.</p>
<p>This is an excerpt from a story I was working on about a queer couple trying to adjust and survive under a dystopian government. I never thought of a name that really worked for it, so it remains unnamed. It switched between the first-person viewpoint of a queer couple, Hadrian and his partner Sinclair. I never ended up finishing this one mainly because it was around the beginning of winter, which meant that basically every Oregonian was becoming vitamin D deficient, which meant that I was no longer in a position to continue writing about depressing subjects.</p>
